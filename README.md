# UG-VAE
This repository contains the official implementation of the Unsupervised Global VAE (**UG-VAE**) model proposed in the 
paper [Unsupervised Learning of Global Factors in Deep Generative Models](). UG-VAE  learns both local and global 
disentanglement from random batches of data in a fully unsupervised manner, which leads to  a promising performance in 
domain alignment and discovering non-trivial underlying structures.
